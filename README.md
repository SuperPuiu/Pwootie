# Pwootie
Pwootie is a ROBLOX studio bootstrapper written in C, Linux only compatible. It doesn't do anything better than the other bootstrappers, but it does its job good enough. It should note that it's a barebones bootstrapper, but maybe in the future it'll get be better.

# Building
To build from source you need the following: `curl`, `libzip`. Make sure you have them downloaded before attempting to build the project.

# Troubleshooting
There are a few issues to keep in mind, such as the fact that cursor locking is not working (at least on the wayland side). If Vulkan fails to start for whatever reason, [this link might be useful](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301979). If not, open an issue and I'll try to my best to document the issue and to help.
